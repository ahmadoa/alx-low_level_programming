In this project, i'm going to be exploring preprocessing in c and how does it work behind the blinds.

The tasks i worked on while learning are as the following:

- 0-object_like_macro.h: a header file that defines a macro named size as an abbreviation for the token 1024.

- 1-pi.h: a header file that defines a macro named PI.

- 2-main.c: prints name of the it was compiled from.

- 3-function_like_macro.h: a function-like macro ABS(x) that compoutes the absolute value of a number x.

- 4-sum.h: a function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y.
