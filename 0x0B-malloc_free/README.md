Getting familiar with dynamic allocation, specifically malloc and free functions.

The tasks are as the following:
- (0-create_array.c): function that creates and initializes  an array of char
- (1-strdup.c): a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of a string
- (2-str_concat.c): a function that concatenates two strings
- (3-alloc_grid.c): a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers
- (4-free_gris.c): a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by alloc_grid function
- (100-argstostr.c): a function that concatenates all the arguments of the program
