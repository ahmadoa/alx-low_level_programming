In this project, i'll be discovering variadic functions, which are functions that can take any number of arguments without strictly declaring their name and type.

The practicing tasks are as the following:

- 0-sum_them_all.c : a function that returns the sum of all its parameters.

- 1-print_numbers.c : a function that prints the numbers.

- 2-print_strings.c : a function that prints strings.

- 3-print_all.c : a function that prints anything.
